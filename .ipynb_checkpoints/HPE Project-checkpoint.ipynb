Workload Solutions \\ntemplates preconfigure some of the key architecture decisions and make it easier for Sellers to get started and complete a \\ndifferentiated server solution for your customer’s specific workload.  \\n \\nMainstream SKUs  \\nHPE launched the Mainstream SKU initiative as a market -driven approach to Demand Steering. It is a simplified portfolio of our top \\nselling optio ns that meet the current and future market trends. HPE has committed to providing a more predictable and faster \\nexperience for these options.   Mainstream SKUs enjoy higher safety stock levels and have high fulfillment service levels than non -\\nMainstream SKUs. Mainstream orders are fulfilled +30% faster than non -Mainstream orders, have fewer shortages, and better \\nrecovery dates.   This platform has Mainstream SKUs in the options portfolio and is eligible for an improved Mainstream \\nexperience.   Mainstream SKUs are designated with a Mainstream symbol in our configurators.  \\n \\nMainstream Configurations  \\nHPE is using the new Smart Templates technology to present Mainstream configurations.   All the options in a Mainstream \\nconfiguration are pre -selected Mainstream SKUs to optimize the performance, predictability, and fulfillment experience. Check the \\nTemplate section in our configurators for eligible Mainstream configurations.  \\n \\nEuropean Union  Erp Lot 9 Regulation  \\nBeginning on January 1st, 2024, units sold into the European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom, or  \\nSwitzerland must include more efficient AC power supplies: 94% for multi -output and 96% for single -output. H PE Flexible Slot \\npower supplies are single -output, and part numbers 865438 -B21, P03178 -B21, and P44712 -B21 are 96% efficient, thus meeting \\nrequirements.  \\n \\nHPE is on target to fulfil compliant systems ahead of time and will begin enforcing these requirements  in advance to satisfy \\nrequests with the current power supplies by the set deadline.  \\n \\nThis section lists some of the steps required to configure a Factory Integrated Model. To ensure only valid configurations ar e \\nordered,  Hewlett Packard Enterprise recommends the use of an HPE approved configurator. Contact your local sales \\nrepresentative for information on configurable product offerings and requirements.  \\n• Factory Integrated Models must start with a CTO Server.  \\n• FIO indicates that this option is only available as a factory installable option.  \\n• All Factory Integrated Models will be populated with sufficient hard drive blanks based on the number of initial hard drives ordered with the server.  \\n• Some options may not be integrated at the factory. Contact your  local sales representative for additional information.  \\n  '),\n",

These Templates represent \\nthe CTO equivalents of the top -selling BTO configurations. They are intended to provide simple starting points to assist you in \\neasily creating and customizing your desired Server solutions.   HPE Servers that have Platform Templates, developed by HPE \\nProduct Managers, will have a separate tab in the HPE OCA configurator.  \\n \\nWorkload Solutions Templates from HPE  \\nThe Workload Solutions Templates build on the Smart Templates technology to easily d evelop working configurations of the most \\ncompelling Workload Solutions. The templates complement the Reference Builds developed by HPE. Workload Solutions templates preconfigure some of the key architecture decisions and make it easier for Sellers to get started and complete a \\ndifferentiated server solution for your customer’s specific workload.  \\n \\nMainstream SKUs  \\nHPE launched the Mainstream SKU initiative as a market -driven approach to Demand Steering. It is a simplified portfolio of our top \\nselling options  that meet the current and future market trends. HPE has committed to providing a more predictable and faster \\nexperience for these options. Mainstream SKUs enjoy higher safety stock levels and have high fulfillment service levels than non-Mainstream SKUs. Mainstream orders are fulfilled +30% faster than non -Mainstream orders, have fewer shortages, and better \\nrecovery dates. This platform has Mainstream SKUs in the options portfolio and is eligible for an improved Mainstream experie nce. \\nMainstream SKUs are d esignated with a Mainstream symbol in our configurators.  \\n \\nMainstream Configurations  \\nHPE is using the new Smart Templates technology to present Mainstream configurations.   All the options in a Mainstream \\nconfiguration are pre -selected Mainstream SKUs to opt imize the performance, predictability, and fulfillment experience. Check the \\nTemplate section in our configurators for eligible Mainstream configurations.  \\n \\nEuropean Union Erp Lot 9 Regulation  \\nBeginning on January 1st, 2024, units sold into the European Uni on (EU), European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom, or \\nSwitzerland must include more efficient AC power supplies: 94% for multi -output and 96% for single -output. HPE Flexible Slot \\npower supplies are single -output, and part numbers 865438 -B21, P03178 -B21, and P44712 -B21 are 96% efficient, thus meeting \\nrequirements.  \\n \\nHPE is on target to fulfil compliant systems ahead of time and will begin enforcing these requirements in advance to satisfy \\nrequests with the current power supplies by the set deadline.  \\n \\nThis section lists some of the steps required to configure a Factory Integrated Model. To ensure only valid configurations ar e \\nordered,  Hewlett Packard Enterprise recommends the use of an HPE approved configurator. Contact your local sales \\nrepresentative for information on configurable product offerings and requirements.  \\n \\n• Factory Integrated Models must start with a CTO Server.  \\n• FIO indicates that this option is only available as a factory installable option.  \\n• All Factory Integrated Models will  be populated with sufficient hard drive blanks based on the number of initial hard drives \\nordered with the server.  \\n• Some options may not be integrated at the factory.

These Templates represent \\nthe CTO equivalents of the top -selling BTO configurations. They are intended to provide simple starting points to assist you in \\neasily creating and customizing your desired Server solutions.   HPE Servers that have Platform Templates, developed by HPE \\nProduct Managers, will have a separate tab in the HPE OCA configurator.  \\n \\nWorkload Solutions Templates from HPE  \\nThe Workload Solutions Templates build on the Smart Templates technology to easily d evelop working configurations of the most \\ncompelling Workload Solutions. The templates complement the Reference Builds developed by HPE. Workload Solutions templates preconfigure some of the key architecture decisions and make it easier for Sellers to get started and complete a \\ndifferentiated server solution for your customer’s specific workload.  \\n \\nMainstream SKUs  \\nHPE launched the Mainstream SKU initiative as a market -driven approach to Demand Steering. It is a simplified portfolio of our top \\nselling options  that meet the current and future market trends. HPE has committed to providing a more predictable and faster \\nexperience for these options. Mainstream SKUs enjoy higher safety stock levels and have high fulfillment service levels than non-Mainstream SKUs. Mainstream orders are fulfilled +30% faster than non -Mainstream orders, have fewer shortages, and better \\nrecovery dates. This platform has Mainstream SKUs in the options portfolio and is eligible for an improved Mainstream experie nce. \\nMainstream SKUs are d esignated with a Mainstream symbol in our configurators.  \\n \\nMainstream Configurations  \\nHPE is using the new Smart Templates technology to present Mainstream configurations.   All the options in a Mainstream \\nconfiguration are pre -selected Mainstream SKUs to opt imize the performance, predictability, and fulfillment experience. Check the \\nTemplate section in our configurators for eligible Mainstream configurations.  \\n \\nEuropean Union Erp Lot 9 Regulation  \\nBeginning on January 1st, 2024, units sold into the European Uni on (EU), European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom, or \\nSwitzerland must include more efficient AC power supplies: 94% for multi -output and 96% for single -output. HPE Flexible Slot \\npower supplies are single -output, and part numbers 865438 -B21, P03178 -B21, and P44712 -B21 are 96% efficient, thus meeting \\nrequirements.  \\n \\nHPE is on target to fulfil compliant systems ahead of time and will begin enforcing these requirements in advance to satisfy \\nrequests with the current power supplies by the set deadline.  \\n \\nThis section lists some of the steps required to configure a Factory Integrated Model. To ensure only valid configurations ar e \\nordered,  Hewlett Packard Enterprise recommends the use of an HPE approved configurator. Contact your local sales \\nrepresentative for information on configurable product offerings and requirements.  \\n \\n• Factory Integrated Models must start with a CTO Server.  \\n• FIO indicates that this option is only available as a factory installable option.  \\n• All Factory Integrated Models will  be populated with sufficient hard drive blanks based on the number of initial hard drives \\nordered with the server.  \\n• Some options may not be integrated at the factory.

These Templates represent the \\nCTO equivalents of the top -selling BTO configurations. They are intended to provide  simple starting points to assist you in easily \\ncreating and customizing your desired Server solutions.   HPE Servers that have Platform Templates, developed by HPE Product \\nManagers, will have a separate tab in the HPE OCA configurator.  \\n \\nWorkload Solutions  Templates from HPE  \\nThe Workload Solutions Templates build on the Smart Templates technology to easily develop working configurations of the most  \\ncompelling Workload Solutions. The templates complement the Reference Builds developed by HPE. Workload Soluti ons templates \\npreconfigure some of the key architecture decisions and make it easier for Sellers to get started and complete a differentiat ed \\nserver solution for your customer’s specific workload.  \\n \\nMainstream SKUs  \\nHPE launched the Mainstream SKU initiative  as a market -driven approach to Demand Steering. It is a simplified portfolio of our top \\nselling options that meets  the current and future market trends. HPE is  committed to providing  a more predictable and faster \\nexperience for these options.   Mainstream SKUs enjoy higher safety stock levels and have higher fulfilment service levels than non-\\nMainstream SKUs. Mainstream orders are fulfilled +30% faster than non -Mainstream orders, have fewer shortages and better \\nrecovery dates.   This platform has Mainstream SKUs in the options portfolio and  is eligible for the improved Mainstream \\nexperience.   Mainstream SKUs are designated with a Mainstream symbol in our configurators.  \\n \\nMainstream Configurations  \\nHPE is using the new Smart Templates technology to present Mains tream configurations.   All the options in a Mainstream \\nconfiguration are pre -selected Mainstream SKUs to optimize the performance, predictability,  and fulfilment experience. Check the \\nTemplate section in our configurators for eligible Mainstream configurat ions.  \\n \\nThis section lists some of the steps required to configure a Factory Integrated Model.  \\nTo ensure valid configurations are ordered,  Hewlett Packard Enterprise recommends the use of an HPE approved configurator. \\nContact your local sales representative for information on configurable product offerings and requirements.  \\n• Factory Integrated Models must start with a CTO Server.  \\n• FIO indicates that this option is only available as a factory installable option.  \\n• Some options may not be integrated at the factory.

These Templates represent the \\nCTO equivalents of the top -selling BTO configurations. They are intended to provide simple starting points to assist you in easily \\ncreating and customizing your desired Server solutions.   HPE Servers that have Platform Templates, developed by HPE Product \\nManagers, will have a separate tab in the HPE OCA configurator.  \\n \\nWorkload Solutions Templates from HPE  \\nThe Workload Solutions Templates build on the Smart Templates technology to easily d evelop working configurations of the most \\ncompelling Workload Solutions. The templates complement the Reference Builds developed by HPE. Workload Solutions templates \\npreconfigure some of the key architecture decisions and make it easier for Sellers to get started and complete a differentiated \\nserver solution for your customer’s specific workload.  \\n \\nMainstream SKUs  \\nHPE launched the Mainstream SKU initiative as a market -driven approach to Demand Steering. It is a simplified portfolio of our top \\nselling options  that meet the current and future market trends. HPE has committed to provide a more predictable and faster \\nexperience for these options.   Mainstream SKUs enjoy higher safety stock levels and have higher fulfilment service levels than non -\\nMainstream SKUs. Mainstream orders are fulfilled +30% faster than non -Mainstream orders, have fewer shortages and better \\nrecovery dates.   This platform has Mainstream SKUs in the options portfolio, and is eligible for the improved Mainstream \\nexperience.   Mainstream SKUs are designated with a Mainstream symbol in our configurators.  \\n \\nMainstream Configurations  \\nHPE is using the new Smart Templates technology to present Mainstream configurations.   All the options in a Mainstream \\nconfiguration are pre -selected Mainstream SKUs to optimize the performance, predictability and fulfilment experience. Check the \\nTemplate section in our configurators for eligible Mainstream configurations.  \\n \\nThis section lists some of the steps required to configure a Factory Integrated Model. To ensure  only valid configurations are \\nordered,  Hewlett Packard Enterprise recommends the use of an HPE approved configurator. Contact your local sales \\nrepresentative for information on configurable product offerings and requirements.  \\n• Factory Integrated Models must start with a CTO Server.  \\n• FIO indicates that this option is only available as a factory installable option.  \\n• All Factory Integrated Models will be populated with sufficient hard drive blanks based on the number of initial hard drives \\nordered with the server.  \\n• Some options may not be integrated at the factory. Contact your local sales representative for additional information.  \\nStep 1: Base Configuration  (choose one (1) of the following four (4) configurable server models from the tables below ) \\nThe below ( 4) CTO server models , denoted with “NC” in the SKU description, provide flexibility in the networking choice and \\nrequire a network adapter  from the “HPE Networking” section  be selected.  \\n \\nNetworking Choice CTO \\nServer Models  HPE ProLiant DL380 \\nGen11 8LFF  \\nNC CTO Server  HPE ProLiant DL380 \\nGen11 12LFF  \\nNC CTO Server  HPE ProLiant DL380 \\nGen11 8SFF  \\nNC CTO Server  HPE ProLiant DL380 \\nGen11 24SFF  \\nNC CTO Server  \\nSKU Number  P52532 -B21 P5253 3-B21 P5253 4-B21 P5253 5-B21 \\nTAA SKU * P52532 -B21#GTA  P52533 -B21#GTA  P52534 -B21#GTA  P52535 -B21#GTA  \\nHPE Trusted Supply Chain   P36394 -B21 – Optional  \\nProcessor  Not included as \\nstandard  Not included as \\nstandard  Not included as \\nstandard  Not included as \\nstandard  \\nDIMM Slots  32-DIMM slots  32-DIMM slots  32-DIMM slots  32-DIMM slots  \\nStorage  Controller  Embedded SW RAID with 14 SATA ports (12 -ports accessible),  optional  choice of HPE modular \\nMegaRAID controller.   \\nPCIe  Three standard in primary riser  \\nDrive Cage - available  8LFF  12LFF  8 SFF  (8SFF U.3 x1)  24SFF  (3x 8SFF U.3 \\nx1) '),\n",

These Templates represent \\nthe CTO equivalents of the top -selling BTO configurations. They are intended to provide simple starting points to assist you in \\neasily creating and customizing your desired Server solutions.   HPE Servers that have Platform Templates, developed by HPE \\nProduct Managers, will have a separate tab in the HPE OCA configurator.  \\n \\nWorkload Solutions Templates from HPE  \\nThe Wor kload Solutions Templates build on the Smart Templates technology to easily develop working configurations of the most \\ncompelling Workload Solutions. The templates complement the Reference Builds developed by HPE. Workload Solutions \\ntemplates preconfigure some of the key architecture decisions and make it easier for Sellers to get started and complete a \\ndifferentiated server solution for your customer’s specific workload.  \\n \\nMainstream SKUs  \\nHPE launched the Mainstream SKU initiative as a market -driven approac h to Demand Steering. It is a simplified portfolio of our top \\nselling options that meet the current and future market trends. HPE has committed to provide a more predictable and faster \\nexperience for these options.   Mainstream SKUs enjoy higher safety stoc k levels and have higher fulfilment service levels than \\nnon- Mainstream SKUs. Mainstream orders are fulfilled +30% faster than non -Mainstream orders, have fewer shortages and better \\nrecovery dates.   This platform has Mainstream SKUs in the options portfolio , and is eligible for the improved Mainstream \\nexperience.   Mainstream SKUs are designated with a Mainstream symbol in our configurators.  \\n \\nMainstream Configurations  \\nHPE is using the new Smart Templates technology to present Mainstream configurations.   All the options in a Mainstream \\nconfiguration are pre -selected Mainstream SKUs to optimize the performance, predictability and fulfilment experience. Check the \\nTemplate section in our configurators for eligible Mainstream configurations.  \\n \\n \\nThis section lists  some of the steps required to configure a Factory Integrated Model. To ensure only valid configurations are \\nordered,  Hewlett Packard Enterprise recommends the use of an HPE approved configurator. Contact your local sales \\nrepresentative for information on configurable product offerings and requirements.  \\n• Factory Integrated Models must start with a CTO Server.  \\n• FIO indicates that this option is only available as a factory integratable option.  \\n• All Factory Integrated Models will be populated with sufficient hard  drive blanks based on the number of initial hard drives \\nordered with the server.  \\n• Some options may not be integrated at the factory. Contact your local sales representative for additional information.  \\n• Beginning on January 1st, 2024, units sold into the Eur opean Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA), the United \\nKingdom, or Switzerland must include more efficient AC power supplies: 94% for multi -output and 96% for single- output. \\nHPE Flexible Slot power supplies are single -output, and part numbers 865438 -B21, P03178 -B21, and P44712- B21 are \\n96% efficient, thus meeting requirements.
